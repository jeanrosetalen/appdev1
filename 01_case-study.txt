Case Study

1. As a manager, I will have to set a meeting within my team members, inform them about the issue that we're facing and that I will have to rearranged the schedule that was already prepared for each team member, but first I will have to consult them with the progress of their assigned task before making any decision. So that, I can designate the task that was left by one of my team member to someone whose task will not be compromise. In this way, we can go back on track and accomplish things on the right time. I may have to inform our clients about the said issue so that they are aware about the progress of the project and assure them that everything will be done on time.

2. As a developer, I will have to first inform my manager about my dilemma so that we can have more options of what to do. I will have to ask for an extension for my task and if given a chance to I will not waste a time and deal with my family emergency first. And get back on track as soon as we're already out the crisis. This might be unprofessional, but things really happen unexpectedly and we have to consider our personal and professional life. With that said we really have to inform the relevant person about our matters so that it will not be just us to think how to fix a problem.

3. I think it is best to be considerate at the very beginning, before starting the work on the project. For example, when making a schedule for the said project. The timeline for each task must be considerate enough so that the person assigned to it will have the time to deal with different circumstances they might face along the process. As for the developer, it is best to be prepared at all times. To have plan for our family and for our career. Because we're not really sure about what is going to happen in our life and how it could affect our personal and professional life. So, it is best to be mindful and prepared because everything is crucial and important.
